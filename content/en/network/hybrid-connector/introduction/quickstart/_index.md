## First steps with your HybridConnector

### Provisioning

The whole provisioning prozess ist automated. During the deployment the
VPN configuration for the Fortigate firewall of the remote end is created as well.
If our engineers don't do this, i.E. f they don't have access to your remote
VPN end, you need to paste this configuration to your Fortigate firewall,
and create firewall rules for the VPN connection.

### Connectivity check

Assure yourself, that all required systems are reachable via the HybridConnector.
